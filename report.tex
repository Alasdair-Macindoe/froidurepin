\section*{Introduction}
Whilst enumerating finite semigroups is computationally expensive there are algorithms that can run - in a practical sense - faster than naively enumerating
the semigroup. One example of this algorithm was published in 1997 by Froidure and Pin\cite{fpin} (which will hereby be called the Froidure-Pin algorithm).
Unfortunately this algorithm does not run concurrently which is a problem for modern computational problems; thus this lead to another version of Froidure-Pin to be
published\cite{cfp} (which we will henceforth call the concurrent Froidure-Pin) which can run concurrently and for which a C++ implementation exists\cite{cfpcpp}.
\newline

The aim of this project was to re-implement the concurrent Froidure-Pin algorithm in HPC-GAP\cite{GAP4} and analyse its scalability.
The full repository for this project can be found on Github\cite{project}.

\section*{Structure}
All the code can be located on Github\cite{project}. The following may be of interest:
\newline
\begin{description}
\item \texttt{README.md}: Installation and testing instructions
\item \texttt{versions.md}: Explanation of implementation details
\item \texttt{runtimes.md}: Raw data from experiments
\item \texttt{data.md}: Explanation of different semigroups for testing
\item \texttt{experiment.g}: File to run experiments
\item \texttt{gap/}: Various implementations
\item \texttt{tst/}: The test file
\end{description}

\section*{Implementation}
\texttt{Version 2.1} is an exact implementation of the version given in the paper. Since the paper does not dictate what data structures should be used
the full implementation details can be found in \texttt{versions.md}. This gives very detailed overview of the algorithm and why it can run locklessly,
as well as the reasons for the specific data structures.

\section*{Analysis}
Please refer to \texttt{runtimes.md} for the raw data, only summaries are provided below.

\section*{Contributions to HPC-GAP}
A bug in HPC-GAP was discovered which would cause a segmentation fault when an empty list was attempted to be migrated between tasks.
This was fixed by Dr Markus Pfeiffer\cite{hpcsol}.

\section*{Future Work}
We have identified some potential future works that could be done:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Fix any outstanding bugs and perform more significant testing
\item Covert data structures across to the HPC-GAP's datastructures package\cite{ds}
\item Investigate performance increases by using HPC-GAP's threads and processes API
\item Investigate performance increases in HPC-GAP's tasks system
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Conclusion}
