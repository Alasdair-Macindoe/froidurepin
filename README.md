# parallel-sgrp-gap

The ultimate aim of this project is to implement Froidure-Pin Semigroup-Enumeration in HPC-GAP and evaluate its performance and scalability in relation to the C++ implementation, find performance bottlenecks, and work on improvements or more HPC-GAP idiomatic algorithm design.

More information will be made available as the project develops if necessary.

# Installation

Please place in the correct pkg folder such as either `gap/pkg` or `hpcgap/pkg`.  This can be done by navigating to the correct folder and executing a `git clone` command such as `git clone https://github.com/Alasdair-Macindoe/parallel-sgrp-gap froidurepin`.

Then you can load the package from within GAP by using `LoadPackage("froidurepin")`.
