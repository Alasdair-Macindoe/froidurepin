# parallel-sgrp-gap

The ultimate aim of this project is to implement Froidure-Pin Semigroup-Enumeration in HPC-GAP and evaluate its performance and scalability in relation to the C++ implementation, find performance bottlenecks, and work on improvements or more HPC-GAP idiomatic algorithm design.

More information will be made available as the project develops if necessary.
